Batch (fast) TypeScript compiler for Meteor

This is experimental at the moment; you're free to use it and file bugs, but it's a hacky approach to performing a batch compilation without proper Meteor support. (It creates a placeholder file that indicates Meteor has handed the plugin all of the main source files -- look through the source if you're curious how it works.)
